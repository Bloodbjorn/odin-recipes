            <li>Place about 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons(small mound) shredded cheese in the center of each flattened biscuit. top with about 6 to 8 pepperoni slices, more if you wish. Keep filling away from edges.</li>
            <li>Tuck filling into center as you roll the biscuits beginning on one end to look like a hot dog roll.</li>
            <li>slice tops diagonally to allow venting, but only lightly, top layer of dough only.</li>
            <li>Bake at 350 F for about 15 to 17 minutes. Allow to cool for 3 to 4 minutes, be careful the melted cheese filling can get very hot.</li>
