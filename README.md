HTML Coding and Git Testing

The goal of this project was to create a recipe website with three recipe pages as well as introduce me to the proper etiquette and conduct as well as to use the tools that up until now were used just as a means of teaching including git, github, and VS Studio as well as to test out my knowledge in HTML to create an interactable webpage that goes between my own relational webpages to copy that of a common cooking recipe site.

Overall, a good start.
